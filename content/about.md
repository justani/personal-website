Hi there, I am Aniruddh Dubey, Software Engineer at CodeChef (Unacademy). I have been working full time on production applications of CodeChef for about a year now. I love problem-solving, learning, reading, teaching, and traveling. 

I love building stuff (product, process, etc.) that can help improve people's lives. I want to make the world a better place by finding ways to create the most impact. 

My biggest source of learning has always been books and new places. Reading books and going to new places opens up my mind to what's possible. I firmly believe that education has the real potential to change the world for the better. 

I look forward to combining my passion for Technology and Education to make an impact.

**My Favorite quote:**
_Those who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world are the ones who do._

**My Favorite book:**
_The story of my experiments with Truth by Mahatma Gandhi_
