Nowadays, I keep myself busy with reading biographies of famous personalities of the world. I am a natural introvert who can't go out and talk about life with people. I can always talk business, but if you want me to open up and share life and ask you to share your life with me, not possible.

But I want to learn more about life and how I can contribute more to the world. I am sure that can't happen if I don't put myself in diverse experiences and learn from people. So I figured out that biographies of great people are the best way to get a deep look at other people's lives and learn from them.

I must admit, I am a follower. I rarely have great ideas of my own. But I diligently follow the great ideas of other people once I am convinced about their value. So why not follow the ideas of the best people?

Reading biographies of great people helps in humanizing them. Most of the time, we hear names like Gandhi, Mandela, Lincoln, etc. We know that they were world leaders and that they made huge differences in the world. We hear their words quoted all the time. But not many of us stop and think that they were also human beings like us. Even though they became world-renowned figures, once they were also unknown and naive like most of us.

Biographies of these people give direction to my life. I can use the tools they used to make decisions in challenging situations. I can see and follow the extent to which they sacrificed most other pleasures of life for just one or two things.

Biographies give hope that a Gandhi or Mandela resides in each one of us. They were not different than any of us. That we should never demean ourselves or think ourselves unworthy, we should understand that our actions make all the difference and not some inherent talent or luck.

Some biographies that I have read till now
1. Steve Jobs: A biography
2. Surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman!
3. The story of My Experiments with Truth
4. Long Walk to Freedom

I will keep updating the list as I read more.
I will also try to post my learning from these books.
