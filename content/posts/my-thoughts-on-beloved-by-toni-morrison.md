I recently read Beloved by Toni Morrison. I read it as a part of our monthly book club at the office. Here are some of my thoughts on reading the book.

Noble laureate Ms. Morrison has presented the biggest evil of humankind in a straightforward and digestible way. Nowadays, it's difficult for most of us to even think of slavery, of buying and selling humans. But there was a time when all of it was normal. Humans were treated like animals, and they were bought, used, whipped, murdered, raped, all legally. Some people decided that one kind of skin color is superior to others and then gradually stopped treating other people of color as humans.

Beloved presents the stories of few such people who lived in a slave farmhouse named "Sweet home." The main character of the story is Sethe, a previously enslaved woman at Sweet Home who fled the place with her children to live a free life with her mother-in-law. But she never became free, even after getting away from slavery.

It shows how slavery had long-lasting effects on the people who experienced it. Even when people were free, they kept living in fear of being caught again, whipped, forced to work till death. It shows us the extent to which a person can go to save her children from slavery, literally killing them to keep them free. Sethe felt nothing wrong in killing her daughter to keep her from getting enslaved like herself.

The most horrifying character in this story was the "Schoolteacher," a white man who took possession of Sweet Home after the previous owner was dead. The schoolteacher treated slaves like animals, noting their human and animal-like behaviors in his notebook. His ways led to an attempt of running away by all the workers of Sweet home, killing and making mad some of them in the process.

All in all, it is a story of pain and struggle that so many previously enslaved people faced even after becoming free. It helps us understand how cruel acts of men can destroy other people's lives long after they were done. It helps us become more empathetic towards any person who had to bear some kind of cruelty either to them or to their loved ones. It's hard for anyone with such a past to reconcile with it and understand that they don't have to attach their identity to it. Understanding that you going through all of it doesn't have to affect your future and that it is possible to start a better life by accepting the past is very crucial.
